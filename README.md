## Deprecated

This repository is deprecated due to the Ronin chain has been migrated to the new organization:
Please refer to the following repositories for the latest Ronin implementation:
- [ronin](https://github.com/ronin-chain/ronin)

## Go Ronin

Official Golang execution layer implementation of the Ronin protocol. It is a fork of Go Ethereum -
[https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and EVM compatible.

Ronin consensus currently uses Delegated Proof of Stake mechanism, allowing anyone to become validator.

|  **`ronin`**   | Our main Ronin CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ronin network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ronin network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `ronin --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options.          |
|   `clef`    | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `ronin`.  |
|   `devp2p`    | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain. |
|   `abigen`    | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details. |
|  `bootnode`   | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|     `evm`     | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Running `ronin`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Requirements
Running a full Ronin node:
- CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: At least 1 TB high-speed SSD
- Network: Reliable IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port

Running an archive Ronin node:
- CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: At least 5 TB high-speed SSD
- Network: Reliable IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port

### Building the source
Building `ronin` requires both a Go (version 1.17 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make ronin
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

### Init genesis

Before running a full node, init genesis block is necessary
```shell
ronin init --datadir /opt/ronin genesis/mainnet.json
```

### Full node on the main Ronin network


```shell
$ ronin --http.api eth,net,web3,consortium --networkid 2020 --discovery.dns enrtree://AIGOFYDZH6BGVVALVJLRPHSOYJ434MPFVVQFXJDXHW5ZYORPTGKUI@nodes.roninchain.com --datadir /opt/ronin --port 30303 --http --http.corsdomain '*' --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.port 8545 --http.vhosts '*' --ws --ws.addr 0.0.0.0 --ws.port 8546 --ws.origins '*' 
```

This command will:
* Start `ronin` in full sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
  causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
  of the Ronin network, which is very CPU intensive.

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `ronin` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ ronin --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ ronin --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `ronin` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `ronin` and the
Ronin network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `ronin` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs which are the same as Ethereum that can be found at ([standard APIs](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)
and [`ronin` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `ronin`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

* `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
* `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
* `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
* `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
* `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
* `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
* `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
* `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
* `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**
